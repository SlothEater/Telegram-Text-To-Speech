# Usage Guide

This document provides detailed instructions on how to use the OpenAI & ElevenLabs Text-to-Speech Telegram Bot.

## Starting the Bot

1. Start a conversation with the bot in the Telegram app. You can do this by searching for the bot's username in the search bar.

2. Start the conversation with the `/start` command.

## Setting API Keys

1. The bot uses the OpenAI and ElevenLabs APIs, so you need to set the respective API keys.

2. To set the OpenAI API key, use the command `/openai {OPENAI-API-KEY}`, where `{OPENAI-API-KEY}` is your OpenAI API key.

3. To set the ElevenLabs API key, use the command `/elevenlabs {ELEVENLABS-API-KEY}`, where `{ELEVENLABS-API-KEY}` is your ElevenLabs API key.

## Using the Bot

1. After setting up the API keys, you can use the `/voices` command to get a list of available TTS voices from ElevenLabs.

2. You can then use the `/set_voice` command followed by the name or ID of a voice to set the TTS voice.

3. To send a message, simply type your message in the chat box and send it. The bot will respond with a text message generated by GPT-3.5 and an audio message of the same response using a TTS voice from ElevenLabs.

## Resetting the Bot

If you want to reset the bot's settings, restart the docker container.
