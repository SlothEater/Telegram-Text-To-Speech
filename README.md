# OpenAI & ElevenLabs Text-to-Speech Telegram Bot

This is a Telegram bot that integrates OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and ElevenLabs's Text-to-Speech (TTS) APIs. It allows you to type a message to the bot, and the bot will respond with a text message generated by GPT-3.5 and an audio message of the same response using a TTS voice from ElevenLabs.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the bot up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have the following installed on your machine:

- Docker

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the root directory of the project.
3. Run the command `docker build -t telegram-bot .` to build the Docker image.
4. Run the command `docker run -d -p 8443:8443 --env TELEGRAM_TOKEN=<Your-Telegram-Token> telegram-bot` to start a Docker container with the bot.

Replace `<Your-Telegram-Token>` with your Telegram bot token. If you don't have one, you can create a new bot on the Telegram app by talking to the BotFather.

### Configuration

The bot uses the OpenAI and ElevenLabs APIs, so you need to set the API keys for these services in the bot. The `/openai` and `/elevenlabs` commands allow you to set the respective API keys.

To set the OpenAI API key, use the command `/openai {OPENAI-API-KEY}`, where `{OPENAI-API-KEY}` is your OpenAI API key.

To set the ElevenLabs API key, use the command `/elevenlabs {ELEVENLABS-API-KEY}`, where `{ELEVENLABS-API-KEY}` is your ElevenLabs API key.

You can use the `/voices` command to get a list of available TTS voices from ElevenLabs. You can then use the `/set_voice` command followed by the name or ID of a voice to set the TTS voice.

## Usage

See [USAGE.md](USAGE.md) for detailed instructions on how to use the bot.

## API Keys Setup
